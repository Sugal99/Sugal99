### Hi there 👋
My name is Sugal Aden, i´m 23 years old born 1999. I am currenly studying Front-end development, which im pursuing at Noroff Vocational School. Growing up i´ve always loved the idea of coding and design, and because of that i naturally ended up finding something that included the usage of both components, and that is Frontend. So even before i started studying Frontend i always would sit down and practise everyday to get better, so that i could prepare myself for when i actually start studying and pursing it as a carrer, which im now thankful for years later down the line.
Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript
- 😄 I’m currently attending Frontend Development at Noroff Vocational Online School
- 💬 Ask me about anything ill try my best to answer questions related to my Github, and if there is anything i can´t answer, then ill let you know :D.
- 📫 How to reach me: The only way to reach me, as of now is through my discord below.
