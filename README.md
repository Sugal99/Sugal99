### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Sugal Aden, iÂ´m 25 years old, born 1999. I have recently gratuaded from my Front-end development studies at Noroff Vocational School. Growing up iÂ´ve always loved the idea of coding and design, and because of that i naturally ended up finding something that included the usage of both components, and that is Frontend. So even before i started studying Frontend i would always sit down and practise everyday to get better so that i could prepare myself for when i actually start studying and pursing it as a carrer, which im now thankful for years later down the line.

Here are some stuff im working on right now:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React and other React-libraries
- ðŸ˜„ Recently gratuaded Frontend Development at Noroff Vocational Online School
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything ill try my best to answer questions related to my Github, and if there is anything i canÂ´t answer, then ill let you know :D.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: The only way to reach me, as of now is through my discord below or my email..
